Trying to download photos from a group on flickr using the python api

I am trying to pull photos from a trip I took years ago so I can create a book. The images were contributed by multiple people and I would like to make sure that their name and date go in the photo credit. Therefore I need to get the metadata attached to each file preferably in the filename.
